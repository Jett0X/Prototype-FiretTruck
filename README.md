<h3>
Arduino Based Automated Firefighting Rover with Extendable Extinguishing System: Safer Alternative for Firefighting
</h3>

<h4>
This research explores the development of an Arduino-based automated firefighting rover designed to enhance the safety and efficiency of firefighters during emergency incidents. Recognizing the significant risks firefighters face, including exposure to hazardous chemicals and the physical and emotional demands of their duties, this study aims to mitigate these challenges by introducing a robotic solution capable of autonomously detecting and extinguishing fires in environments that are difficult for humans to access. 
</h4>
<h4>
The rover incorporates advanced sensors and an extendable extinguishing system, allowing it to operate effectively in extreme conditions, such as intense heat and smoke. Through controlled testing, the study assesses the rover's fire detection accuracy, extinguishing effectiveness, and overall impact on firefighter safety. The findings are expected to provide valuable insights for fire departments and emergency response teams, ultimately contributing to improved firefighting technology and strategies while reducing the risk of injury to personnel. By reallocating the fire extinguishing responsibility to the automated rover, firefighters can focus on other critical tasks, enhancing overall incident management and improving outcomes for victims.
